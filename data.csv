rewilding,rewilding,personal,2023,game,"<p>Rewilding is a meditative ecology game about growing a forest between long stretches of cryogenic hibernation. The story follows Syd and their mandated AI companion Geva as Syd struggles to unpack what brought them so far away from society. Through the centuries, Syd and Geva work to interface with a recovering ecosystem and foster a new normal. As the world moves on without them, Syd will have to decide what to do when their assignment ends.</p><p>Gameplay focuses on an ecological simulation where plants are your main tools. Players choose plants based on their unique contributions to the overall ecosystem and work towards building a self-sustaining community of flora. As the years pass by, players will wander through a forest they helped design--a living, breathing entity all its own. </p>
